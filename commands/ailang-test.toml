# Run AILANG plugin tests
# Usage: /ailang:test

description = "Run AILANG bootstrap plugin tests to verify everything works"

prompt = """
Run the full test suite to verify the plugin is working correctly:

```bash
./tests/run_tests.sh
```

## What Gets Tested

1. **AILANG CLI** - Is ailang installed and working?
2. **Type Checking** - Do test programs type-check?
3. **Execution** - Do programs produce expected output?
4. **Skills** - Are all skills properly structured?
5. **Slash Commands** - Do all commands have proper frontmatter?
6. **MCP Server** - Can MCP tools execute?

## Manual Verification

After running tests, verify these work:

```bash
ailang prompt                                    # Should output syntax rules
ailang run --caps IO --entry main tests/programs/hello.ail  # Should output: Hello, AILANG!
ailang builtins list | head -20                 # Should list builtin functions
```

All tests should pass. If any fail, check AILANG installation with `ailang --version`.
