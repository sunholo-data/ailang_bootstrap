Run `ailang prompt` and read the output carefully. This contains the current syntax rules and templates you MUST follow when writing AILANG code.

After loading, confirm you understand:
1. Use `func` not `fn` or `function`
2. Semicolons between statements
3. Pattern matching uses `=>`
4. No loops - use recursion
5. Everything is immutable
