description: Load the AILANG teaching prompt (essential before writing code)

**CRITICAL: Run this before writing any AILANG code!**

```bash
ailang prompt
```

This outputs the current AILANG syntax rules, templates, and examples that are the source of truth for writing correct code.

The teaching prompt includes:
- Mandatory program structure
- Import syntax
- Function definitions
- Pattern matching
- Effect annotations
- Common pitfalls

After running this, you'll have the current syntax fresh in context for writing code.
