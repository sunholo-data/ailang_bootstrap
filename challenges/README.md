# AILANG Challenges

A library of coding challenges designed to teach AILANG by doing.

Each challenge guides you to build something impressive while learning AILANG's key features.

## Available Challenges

## Challenge Structure

Each challenge has:
- `challenge.md` - The prompt (what the AI sees)
- `solution.ail` - Working reference (hidden during challenge)
- `hints.md` - Progressive hints if stuck

## Adding New Challenges

1. Create a folder: `challenges/<name>/`
2. Add `challenge.md` with guided discovery prompts
3. Add working `solution.ail`
4. Optionally add `hints.md`
