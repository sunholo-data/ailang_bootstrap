# AILANG Sprint Evaluator

Independently evaluate a completed sprint implementation against its design doc, acceptance criteria, and quality standards. Based on the [generator-evaluator architecture](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps) — separating the agent doing the work from the agent judging it.

## Current State

- **Branch**: !'git branch --show-current'
- **Active sprints**: !'ls .ailang/state/sprints/ 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "none"'
- **Existing evaluations**: !'ls .ailang/state/evaluations/ 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "none"'
- **Test status**: !'make test 2>&1 | tail -1'
- **Lint status**: !'make lint 2>&1 | tail -1'

> **Use the data above first.** Only re-run these commands manually if the injected context is empty or you need to refresh after making changes.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Triggered automatically after sprint-executor, or manually:
# User says: "Evaluate the sprint M-CACHE"
# This skill will:
# 1. Load design doc, sprint plan, and sprint JSON
# 2. Run automated quality checks (tests, lint, coverage)
# 3. Verify each acceptance criterion from sprint JSON
# 4. Score implementation against concrete rubric (100 points)
# 5. PASS (trigger merge) or FAIL (send feedback to sprint-executor)
```

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when:
- Sprint-executor completes and sends handoff message
- User says "evaluate sprint", "review implementation", "assess quality"
- Coordinator triggers via `trigger_on_complete` chain
- User wants independent quality assessment before merge

## Coordinator Integration

**When invoked by the AILANG Coordinator**, output these markers at the end of your response:

```
EVALUATION_RESULT: pass|fail
EVALUATION_SCORE: 85/100
EVALUATION_ROUND: 1
EVALUATION_REPORT_PATH: .ailang/state/evaluations/eval_<sprint-id>_round_<n>.json
FEEDBACK_SUMMARY: <one-line summary if failed>
```

**Agent config:**
```yaml
- id: sprint-evaluator
  label: "Sprint Evaluator"
  inbox: sprint-evaluator
  capabilities: [review, test, docs]
  trigger_on_complete: []  # End of chain on pass
  session_continuity: false  # Stateless per round
  approval:
    needs_label: needs-evaluation-approval
    approved_label: evaluation-approved
```

## Core Principles

1. **Independent Judge** — Never evaluate your own work. This skill judges sprint-executor output
2. **Concrete Criteria** — Score against measurable rubric, not subjective impressions
3. **Skeptical by Default** — Tuned toward skepticism; easier to calibrate than making generators self-critical
4. **Actionable Feedback** — Failed evaluations include specific files, functions, and suggestions
5. **Hard Thresholds** — Some failures (tests broken, <50% criteria met) cause automatic rejection
6. **Bounded Iteration** — Max 3 evaluation rounds before escalating to human review

## Evaluation Phases

### Phase 1: Context Loading

1. **Read handoff message** — Extract sprint_id, branch, sprint JSON path, design doc path
2. **Load sprint JSON** from `.ailang/state/sprints/sprint_<id>.json`
3. **Read design doc** — The original spec (the "contract")
4. **Read sprint plan** — The implementation roadmap with milestones
5. **Review git diff** — `git diff dev...<branch>` to see all changes
6. **Check evaluation round** — Is this round 1, 2, or 3? Load prior report if round > 1

### Phase 2: Automated Checks

Run automated quality checks using the evaluation script:

```bash
.claude/skills/sprint-evaluator/scripts/evaluate_sprint.sh <sprint-id> [branch]
```

This runs:
- `make test` — All tests must pass (HARD FAIL if not)
- `make lint` — Linting must be clean
- `make check-file-sizes` — No files exceeding 800 lines
- `make test-coverage-badge` — Coverage metrics

**When the sprint touches `examples/` or `examples/manifest.json`, ALSO run `make verify-examples` (HARD FAIL if red).** `make test` and `make check-file-sizes` do NOT cover the manifest-drift gate — a sprint that adds an example but omits/leaves-stale its manifest `modules` field passes local `go test` yet fails the CI `test` job's `verify-examples` step (`validate_manifest --ci`). Recurrent class ([[project_verify_examples_red_is_usually_manifest_drift]]); 2nd instance of a manifest defect reaching CI *through* a green evaluator verdict (iter-101, PR #479). If drift is found, fix it surgically (populate the `modules` field for the new entry — do NOT run `backfill_manifest_modules.go`, which reserializes the whole file and churns unrelated unicode-escaped entries) or fail the sprint back to the executor.

### Phase 3: Acceptance Criteria Verification

```bash
.claude/skills/sprint-evaluator/scripts/check_acceptance_criteria.sh <sprint-id>
```

For each feature in sprint JSON:
1. Read `acceptance_criteria` array
2. Verify `passes: true` for each feature
3. For file-related criteria, verify files exist
4. For test-related criteria, verify test functions exist
5. Score: `(criteria_met / total_criteria) * 30 points`

**HARD FAIL if fewer than 50% of acceptance criteria are met.**

### Phase 3.5: Sprint Artifacts Verification

If a sprint JSON exists (`.ailang/state/sprints/sprint_<id>.json`), verify:
1. All milestones have `passes: true` (or `false` with explanation)
2. All milestones have `completed` timestamps
3. All milestones have `notes` with summaries
4. Sprint `status` is `"completed"`
5. Velocity metrics are populated

If a sprint plan markdown exists, verify:
1. All milestones marked with ✅ (not pending or in-progress)
2. No placeholder text remaining

**Scoring**: Deduct from Code Quality (Phase 4) — up to -5 for incomplete sprint artifacts.
Sprint artifacts are optional (pre-sprint-system implementations won't have them), so missing
artifacts are not penalized — only incomplete/inconsistent ones are.

### Phase 4: Design Fidelity Check (AI Judgment)

Read the design doc and compare against the actual implementation:
- Does the implementation match the stated goals?
- Are the architectural decisions consistent with the design?
- Were any design requirements silently dropped?
- Are there unexpected deviations from the spec?

Score 0-10 based on fidelity to design intent.

### Phase 5: Documentation Completeness

Check:
- **CHANGELOG updated** (5 pts) — New entries under appropriate version
- **Example files created** (5 pts) — `examples/runnable/<feature>.ail` for new features
- **Design doc status** (5 pts) — Updated to reflect implementation state

### Phase 6: Scoring & Report Generation

Apply scoring rubric (see [resources/scoring_rubric.md](resources/scoring_rubric.md)):

| Category | Points | Hard Fail? |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Tests Pass | 20 | Yes |
| Lint Clean | 10 | No |
| Acceptance Criteria | 30 | Yes if <50% |
| Code Quality | 15 | No |
| Documentation | 15 | No |
| Design Fidelity | 10 | No |
| Regression Surface Coverage (conditional) | +10 | Yes if triggered with no analysis |
| Performance Verification (conditional) | +10 | Yes if perf sprint with no profile |
| **Total** | **100** (+20 conditional) | **Pass: 70+** |

**Conditional categories**:
- **Regression Surface Coverage** triggers when the sprint touches `internal/parser/`, `internal/lexer/`, `internal/ast/`, `internal/types/`, `internal/elaborate/`, `internal/iface/`, `internal/codegen/`, `internal/eval/`, `internal/vm/`, `internal/effects/`, or `cmd/ailang/exec.go`. Hard fail if triggered without a Conflict Surface analysis in the design doc and fixture tests for the named "Programs that MUST still work". Catches M-TAINT-TYPES-style silent regressions.
- **Performance Verification** triggers on perf sprints (design doc keywords). Hard fail without before/after profiling data.

Generate report:
```bash
.claude/skills/sprint-evaluator/scripts/generate_report.sh <sprint-id> <score> <result> <round>
```

Report saved to `.ailang/state/evaluations/eval_<sprint-id>_round_<n>.json`

### Phase 7: Pass/Fail Decision

**Determine execution mode** before acting:
- **Local mode** (running in an interactive chat session): invoke skills directly
- **Cloud/coordinator mode** (running via coordinator daemon): use inbox messages

**On PASS (score >= 70, no hard fails):**
1. Move design doc from `design_docs/planned/` to `design_docs/implemented/<version>/` —
   **and its companion sprint plans in the same move** (Mark 2026-07-29): any
   `<doc-stem>-sprint-plan.md` / `<doc-stem>-m*-sprint-plan.md` siblings travel WITH the
   design doc. A sprint plan left in `planned/` after its parent lands is folder drift —
   the 2026-07-29 attended triage archived two such strays; don't create more. (Multi-phase
   docs that stay in `planned/` until a later milestone — e.g. an M4b — keep their plans
   beside them until the doc itself moves.)
2. Update design doc status from "Planned" to "Implemented"
3. Output markers with `EVALUATION_RESULT: pass`
4. Post congratulatory summary with score breakdown

**On FAIL (score < 70 or hard fail, round < 3):**

*Local mode — invoke sprint-executor directly:*
1. Generate specific, actionable feedback (see [resources/feedback_templates.md](resources/feedback_templates.md))
2. Invoke the `sprint-executor` skill with the evaluation report path and specific issues
3. After executor completes, re-evaluate (increment round)

*Cloud/coordinator mode — send inbox message:*
1. Generate specific, actionable feedback
2. Send feedback to sprint-executor inbox:

```bash
ailang messages send sprint-executor '{
  "type": "evaluation_feedback",
  "correlation_id": "eval_<sprint-id>_round_<n>",
  "sprint_id": "<sprint-id>",
  "evaluation_round": <n>,
  "score": <score>,
  "issues": [
    {"file": "path/to/file.go", "issue": "description", "suggestion": "how to fix"},
    ...
  ],
  "max_rounds": 3
}' --title "Evaluation Failed (Round <n>/<max>)" --from "sprint-evaluator"
```

3. Output markers with `EVALUATION_RESULT: fail`

**On FAIL (round >= 3):**
1. Escalate to human review
2. Add `needs-human-review` label via coordinator
3. Post summary of all 3 rounds with score progression

## Receiving Handoff from sprint-executor

The evaluator receives an `implementation_complete` message:
```json
{
  "type": "implementation_complete",
  "correlation_id": "eval_M-CACHE_20260326",
  "sprint_id": "M-CACHE",
  "branch_name": "coordinator/task-abc123",
  "sprint_json_path": ".ailang/state/sprints/sprint_M-CACHE.json",
  "design_doc_path": "design_docs/planned/v0_7/M-CACHE.md",
  "files_created": ["internal/cache/store.go"],
  "files_modified": ["internal/server/handler.go"],
  "evaluation_round": 1
}
```

## Execution Modes

The evaluator operates in two modes depending on where it's running:

### Local Mode (interactive chat session)
When running in a user's local Claude Code session:
- **On fail**: Invoke the `sprint-executor` skill directly to fix issues, then re-evaluate
- **On pass**: Move design doc to `implemented/`, update status — no inbox needed
- **Detection**: Default mode. No coordinator markers in the prompt.

### Cloud/Coordinator Mode
When invoked by the coordinator daemon or via agent inbox:
- **On fail**: Send structured feedback message to `sprint-executor` inbox
- **On pass**: Output `EVALUATION_RESULT: pass` markers for coordinator to act on
- **Detection**: Prompt contains coordinator task reference or `implementation_complete` message

## Feedback Loop Architecture

**Local mode:**
```
sprint-evaluator (Round 1)
    ↓
PASS? → move design doc to implemented/, done
FAIL? → invoke sprint-executor skill with issues
            ↓
        sprint-evaluator (Round 2, same session)
            ↓
        PASS? → move design doc, done
        FAIL? → invoke sprint-executor (Round 3)
                    ↓
                PASS? → move design doc, done
                FAIL? → escalate to user for manual review
```

**Cloud/coordinator mode:**
```
sprint-executor completes
        ↓
sprint-evaluator (Round 1)
        ↓
    PASS? → merge approval
    FAIL? → feedback message to sprint-executor
                ↓
        sprint-executor fixes issues
                ↓
        sprint-evaluator (Round 2)
                ↓
            PASS? → merge approval
            FAIL? → feedback message (Round 3)
                        ↓
                    PASS? → merge approval
                    FAIL? → escalate to human (needs-human-review)
```

## Notes

- Evaluation reports are preserved across rounds for audit trail
- Each round's report at `.ailang/state/evaluations/eval_<id>_round_<n>.json`
- The evaluator does NOT modify the sprint JSON — it creates separate evaluation artifacts
- Hard fails (tests broken) cause immediate rejection regardless of score
- Score progression across rounds is tracked in reports for learning
- Evaluator is stateless per round — no session continuity needed
